The Neon Javascript Widget Library
==================================

The Neon Javascript Widget Library aims to provide rich, reliable,
user-friendly user interface controls for use in Javascript web
applications.

The library is built on top of the Neon Javascript Library.  It includes:

- A rich text editing control.  Allowing for rich text editing within the
  browser, this widget includes a user-friendly toolbar and returns the
  rich text content in HTML format, even including a sophisticated HTML
  filter to clean up and somewhat normalise generated HTML.

- A flyout widget, for generating a popup window flying out underneath or
  beside an element.

- A flyoutMenu widget, for specifically generating a popup menu such as a
  drop-down menu or autocomplete menu.

All widgets accept a variety of configuration options and are fully
programmable, allowing functions to hook into actions like showing or
hiding flyouts, and allowing the widget to be controlled or even reset
back to its former state.

If desired, the widgets can be made to animate, with popup windows fading
into view and fading out.

Neon widgets aim to be well-supported on all browsers which support Neon.
Its rich text editor component provides an alternative plain text editor
for use in browsers which do not support in-page rich text editing.

Installation and use
====================

First, the core of the Neon Javascript Library must be installed.  This is
contained within the file neon.js.  This file should be included within
a <script> element in the <head> section of your page.

You can then dynamically load the widget library, contained in
neon.widget.js, using code such as the following:

neon.load('neon.widget.js', function() {
  neon.ready(function() {
    // widget setup code goes here
  });
});

The Javascript files are available in a minified and a source version.  The
minified version is intended for production use and will save bandwidth and
speed up page loads, particularly when your server is configured to use
gzip compression.

Documentation
=============

See http://neonjs.com for documentation and examples of use.

The archive also contains a demos/ directory which contains some small
examples you can run in your browser.
